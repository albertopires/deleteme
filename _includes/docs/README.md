# Multi-homed File Transfer Protocol #

MhFtp is a tool to allow file transfer over a multi-homed host, that is, a host
with more than one Internet link, using one or more links, summing up of all
bandwidths.

## How it works ##
Basically it breaks a file in a number of parts (Chunks), open one connection per
link, and start transferring each each chunk separately. All information about
each chunk, like its size, md5sum, status (DOWNLOADING, PENDING, ERROR) and
full size md5, are stored in a metadata file, using a .mdata extension.

This metadafile will be generated by the server and sent to the client on first
time transfer and will be stored on the client side. Later this .mdata file
may be used to resume transmission, check for chunk errors, and retransmit single
 failed chunks.

As of this version, the chunk size is fixed in 1MB, but very soon it will be
configurable. although the size of 1MB suits a good range of file sizes, for
larger file the metadata file me became big.

## Compiling ##

As of this moment, this version is tested on 64bit Linux and requires:

* GNU g++ 4.8
* libssl-dev 1.0.1f
* Electric Fence (optional)

It's possible to compile MhFtp on older version of g++, although it may necessary
to comment the compile options **-pedantic** and **-std=c++11** on your Makefile.


``CFLAGS=-Wall -g #-pedantic -std=c++11``

and then, just run make.

## Contributing ##
For now it's just me, so I'll try to keep it simple. Basically **master** branch
will have the latest (hopefully stable) version, and there will be a
 **next** branch where I'll work on upcoming features.
For more information take a look at [Contributing](Documentation/CONTRIB.md).

So, fork it and have fun.
